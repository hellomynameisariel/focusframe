# FocusFrame

**FocusFrame** is a lightweight 15-minute task tracker built using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no libraries, no frameworks, no distractions.

Originally created to help an overwhelmed team member break down an insurmountable to-do list, FocusFrame uses timeboxing principles to turn big tasks into approachable wins.
